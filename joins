select * from employee
select * from department
select * from manager 
select * from projects

INNER JOIN:
select emp_name.e,dept_name.d from employee.e inner join department.d on dept_id.e = dept_id.d
**By using the above query, the inner join(this join happening between the entities which are commonly present in both the tables based on the given join condition) between two table can be done by the join condition (dept_id.e = dept_id.d) and there is no need for the columns in the join condition should have the same name, it can be possible by having different column names.

LEFT JOIN:
**Left join= inner joins + any additional records present in the left table
select emp_name.e,dept_name.d from employee.e left join department.d on dept_id.e = dept_id.d
**it will joins all the entities which are in common in between those two columns and remaining entities in the left table will be assigned as null

RIGHT JOIN:
**Right join= inner joins + any additional records present in the right table
select emp_name.e,dept_name.d from employee.e right join department.d on dept_id.e = dept_id.d
**it will joins all the entities which are in common in between those two columns and remaining entities in the right table will be assigned as null

EX. Fetch all the employee name and their manager name, project, dept

select e.employee_name,d.dept_name,m.manager_name,p.project_name from employee e
left join department d on d.dept_id = e.dept_id
inner join manager m on m.manager_id = e.manager_id
left join project p on p.team_member_id = e.emp_id
